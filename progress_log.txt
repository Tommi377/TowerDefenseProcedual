Interim 1 (10.3)
Things added:
	object Main: the main class and responsible for instantiating all the essential classes and acting as the main way to access other classes
	class Window: Extends SimpleSwingApplication. Responsible for handling window related stuff
	class Graphics: Implements the rendering pipeline. Responsible for drawing the map and sprites.
	class UI: UI is responsible for drawing the User Interface on top of the graphics. It will display the buttons and relevant data
	object InputHandles: Responsible for handling all the inputs.
	class Map: Holds all the information about the map grid. Consists of x * y Cell classes
	class Cell: Data of an individual grid cell
	class Perlin: Implements perlin noise which is used for random terrain generation
	classes Game, Placeable, Tower, Enemy and Player: placeholders with little implemented
	
The plan was the get the graphics working well before implementing all the gameplay mechanics. I also had the time to program a randomly generated map
using the Perlin noise algorithm. I'm also implementing my own UI system because I want all the control I can get and I shouldn't have that many 
different UI Elements that it would become a massive undertaking. I've implemented my UI using the Composite design pattern and my Event system 
resembles the Observable design patter

The main difficulty is implementing all the classes with future classes in mind. I want to design this well from the start to avoid future headaches.
I haven't had that much time to work on this project I've only been working for about 15 hours before the first interim. On my project plan I had written
that I should have a working prototype by now but I don't due to the fact that I have not been working on this project as much as I planned.
	
Interim 2 (24.3)
Haven't worked on the project at all since the last Interim. Not really that worried since I only major feature left is monsters/pathfinding.

Interim 3 (7.4)
Things added:
	-Added an implementation for enemies
	-Added A* pathfinding algorithm for enemies
	-Added class Spawner
	-Added an actual game loop
	-Tower's can attack enemies in range
	-Enemies move automatically
	-Added and upgraded UI components
	-Added fog of war
	-Refactoring code
	
I finally got a playable prototype. You can play trough waves and place towers which attack enemies.
I'm somewhat behind the plan because of the break but I should be able to finish the game in time since
I already have a working prototype. Only tests and final touches left. Workload 15h
